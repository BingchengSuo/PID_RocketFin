# PID_RocketFin
Rocket Grid Fin control based on PID algorithm Use Arduino Nana V3.0 and WT901 multifunctional sensor to contruct basic control. This system aims to minimize the self rotation caused by air turbulance. It can also modified to control the yaw, pitch and roll of the rocket. The Algorithm is built upon PID control. PCB files are also included
