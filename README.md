# PID_RocketFin
Rocket Grid Fin control based on PID algorithm Use Arduino Nano V3.0 and WT901 multifunctional sensor to contruct basic control. This system aims to minimize the self rotation caused by air turbulance. The Algorithm is built upon basic PID control and Kalman filter. PCB files are also included. 
Future possible implementation includes: 3-axis control, GNSS guidance, spacial location capture. 

The folder "3D_model" gives a very basic impression one needs to fit in four servos. More campactable design will be uploaded in the future. The "PCB_Output" folder gives the Gerber and Drill file to print the main controll board. PCB is designed using Altium and circuit can be adjusted and expand for more modules. Arduino NANO may not be suitable for more powerful calculation.
